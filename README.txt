README.txt file for pyV3D.

Note: The demo server for this package has not yet been updated to work
with the latest API changes, so unfortunatly it doesn't work at the moment.
This will be addressed in the near future.  Sorry about that.

Note: installing this package does not require cython. If you wish to change
the pyV3D cython code, then you will need to install cython and run it on the src/pyV3D/_pyV3D.pyx file before running 'python setup.py build'.
